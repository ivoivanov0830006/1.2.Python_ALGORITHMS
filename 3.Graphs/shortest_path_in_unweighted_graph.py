# You will be given a graph from the console your task is to find the shortest path

# N the second one the number of Edges - E, then on each E line the edge in form
# {destination} â€“ {source}. On the last two lines, you will read the start node and the end node.
# Print on the first line the length of the shortest path and the second the path itself,
# see the examples below.
